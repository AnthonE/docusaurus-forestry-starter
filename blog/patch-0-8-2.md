# Patch 0.8.2

After the latest round of feedback we decided to ease up on the difficulty of the early game. We gave additional health to the player and made some physics adjustments to make movement more forgiving. Then we modified the controls some and added cyclops traits to the player. Our focus is now on optimizing load time and enhancing performance of the web game while working on mobile builds.

## Bug Fixes
- Added cyclops traits
- Increased health
- Decreased fall drag
- Decreased gravity slightly
- 'Up' and 'W' buttons jump
- Decreased enemy health in level 1 and level 2
- Adjusted difficulty of level 1 traps
