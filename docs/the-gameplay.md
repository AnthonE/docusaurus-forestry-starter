### In-game Item Minting

Holders of the Neogen Space Monkey NFT will be able to mint in-game items and missions that can be completed or sold for Diamonds. Parts and missions can be minted every 7 days. All parts have durability that deteriorates with use, eventually resulting in the item’s destruction. Missions expire if they remain uncompleted after 14 days.

For each Neogen Space Monkey NFT held, players can mint 1 basic part, 1 random mission and 1 weapon. If the held NGSM has an accessory trait or extra weapon, that accessory/weapon can be minted each time as well.

Holding an individual Family Mooks NFT will allow an additional mission to be minted for each held.

Holding a complete Mooks Family will enable an additional mission mint.

**Mint breakdown:**

1 NGSM: 1 Mission, 1 part + weapon(s) + rare traits (if applicable) mint  
1 Family Mook: 1 mission mint  
Full Family Mooks collection: 1 mission mint. This is in addition to the 1 mission mint per Family Mook above (i.e. Full Family = 9 mission mints)

### Avatar Customization

While anyone is able to use a standard avatar, NGSM collectors have an advantage: they can mix and match [parts](/gameplay#parts "parts") from their NGSM NFTs to build custom avatars. Some of the NFT parts are cosmetic, while other parts have in-game advantages such as enhanced health, durability, or speed.

Additional parts can be obtained by destroying an enemy who drops loot, buying from an in-game vendor, or purchasing from the [Depot](/gameplay#depot "Depot"). NGSM collectors are also able to sell unused parts in the depot.

### Missions

Token: ERC-721

Missions are tokens that fuel the main gameplay loop of NGSM: Online. There are 3 basic types of missions: kill missions, repair missions and bounty missions. With the exception of bounty missions, all missions will require a Neogen Space Monkey or Family Mooks NFT to mint, or can be purchased in the [Depot](/gameplay#depot "Depot"). Once minted, all missions will exist as an NFT within the player’s wallet and can be sold or traded to other players. All missions will expire(burn) after a determined period of time if not completed. Missions can be minted every 7 days and will expire after 14 days. These values may change if mission supply needs to be adjusted.

Kill missions require a player to destroy a specified number of enemies in order to collect the reward.

Repair missions require a player to travel to a specified location and interact with an object to repair it before collecting the reward. Sometimes repair missions will require the player to find and collect an item in order to complete the repair. Players will be able to buy or sell items at the [Depot](/gameplay#depot "Depot").

Bounty missions are minted by players to target other players. Each bounty requires a deposit of a fixed number of [Diamond](/tokenomics#diamond "Diamond"), the currency that fuels the economy in NGSM: Online. Bounty missions will be minted via in-game kiosk or NPC that players can interact with and can be sold or traded at the Depot.

### Parts

Token: ERC-721

Parts are tokens used to enhance the main gameplay loop of NGSM: Online. For each Neogen Space Monkey NFT, players will be able to mint at least 1 basic part. Rare NFT traits provide additional part mints.

Each player will have 8 equipment slots in total. Everything but color is rolled on chain; color depends on the NGSM used to mint. Other mint logic is controlled by the multiplayer game server but can be ported on chain.

To combat the problem of equipment piling up, we introduced durability. When an item’s durability reaches zero, its stats are useless. We may introduce a recycle mechanic where the NFT is burned or combined with another.

* 4 Basic Types: body, eyes, teeth, ears
* 2 Advanced Types: accessories and weapons
* 4 Rarities: Simple, Rare, Epic, and Perfect with each tier giving one additional stat point
* 1 Stat: Energy, Speed, Damage, Health, Thorns or Life Drain: with up to 4 stat points
* Durability starts at 100, lose durability from taking damage and upon dying
* Armor starts at 1. It reduces total damage taken and can be modified by items
* Each player will have 8 equipment slots in total
* Weapons will be dependent on the minting NFT’s weapon trait
* Special Neogen Space Monkey traits could potentially modify or unlock part rolls

### Items

Token: ERC-721 or ERC-1155

Some essential basic items will be purchasable from an in-game vendor by using [Diamond](/tokenomics#diamond "Diamond"), either unlimited supply or on timers with limited supply. In-game items will also drop from enemies when they are destroyed. Some items could be in a “phased” state after collecting and require some “dephasing” process to mint and/or reveal them completely.

Consumables are items that can be used for an advantage in-game. For example, a player may use a Health Potion to regain some health points.

### Depot

The depot is simply an in-game Auction House, similar to those in games like World of Warcraft. Players will be able to list in game items for other players to purchase from the depot with [Diamond](/tokenomics#diamond "Diamond").
