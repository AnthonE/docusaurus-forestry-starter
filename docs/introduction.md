## Why

Whether you love them or hate them, NFTs have exploded in popularity over the last year. According to [CNBC,](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/10/trading-in-nfts-spiked-21000percent-to-top-17-billion-in-2021-report.html) trading in NFTs hit $17.6 billion in 2021, which is a massive increase of 21,000% from 2020. Gaming NFTs such as Axie Infinity represented the second-largest category, bringing in $5.2 billion in sales. As incredible as these numbers sound, this is just the beginning. From universal player profiles to unique in-game items that are truly interoperable and more, NFTs have the potential to completely reshape and revitalize the gaming industry. There is huge market opportunity at the intersection of web3 and gaming, says Blockchain Game Alliance. 20% of NFT sales volume in 2021 was gaming-related assets. 49% of crypto wallet activity comes from games; there are 50+ live web3 games with more than 1k unique on-chain users. With the ever-increasing ability to earn income from game play, these numbers will only continue to rise.
